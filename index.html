    <h2 style="color:maroon">"TAK KENAL MAKA TAK CINTA"</h2>

    <p>This is one of the famous phrases in Malaysia which translates to "You can't love what you don't know" in English. 
      The phrase is often used to convey the idea that in order to truly appreciate or care about something, one must first have knowledge of it.
      It is often used to express the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to form a meaningful relationship or connection with something 
      or someone. The phrase can be applied to many different contexts, including personal relationships, cultural appreciation, and even business.
    </p>
    
    <p>It is also used as a reminder that one should not dismiss or ignore something simply because it is unfamiliar or different. Instead, it encourages 
      people to take the time to learn and understand it in order to form a deeper appreciation and connection.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, I welcome you with open arms to explore my world. So, sit back and just unwind while we get to know each other better!

    <p>First and foremost, These are my Parents. My mother's name is Laila Hanim bt Nawawi. Already 49 years old. He works as a clerk at a children's school named PASTI. 
      Before this, he also served as a clerk at a religious school and he quit that service at the beginning of 2020. For me, my mother is a hero in the family because 
      she is very caring, loving, and responsible for us as a family. My mother has no comparison with anyone because she has a very strong soul and sacrifice.
      <br><br>
      Then my father named Sobri bin Mohamad. Aged 54 years. He is a very loving father to his children. He did not work until today as a result of the illness he had to 
      face which made it difficult for him to work. Even though he was the one who faced the problem, his love never faded for us.
      <br><br>
      Even so, my mother and father's relationship stopped in the middle of 2020. For 20 years they went through ups and downs in being a family. Raise us with love. May 
      they be blessed by Allah Taala.

    <p>This is my eldest brother named Muhammad Syafiq bin Sobri. Aged 23 years. A sweet person blessed with a tall body and tan skin. He is a brother with a different 
      character from his other siblings because he is the only one with tan skin. In addition, he really likes to play football with his friends and likes to be friends with 
      many people. Now, he has worked on the side to earn a good living for his family.

      She is the only sister in my siblings. She is a hard worker and often helps my mother in the kitchen when she cooks. She is also a person who is good at studying because 
      he often gets the best achievements.

    <p>Lastly, my youngest brother named Muhammad Mursyid bin Sobri. Now is 12 years old. Attended National School in Central City. He is the last sibling in the family. 
      For me, he is a very close person to my father. Even though they are far apart, he always talks about his father when they were together before. He is active in sports 
      and his hobbies are cycling, playing football, badminton and many more. I hope that he will become a devoted family man one day.

    <img id="profile-picture" src="muslim.png" alt="Profile Picture">

    <p>I want to explore my religion of Islam in depths and gain a deeper understanding of its teachings and principles. I believe that by studying the Quran 
      and Hadith, as well as learning from scholars and experienced practitioners, I will be able to strengthen my faith and become a better Muslim. I also want

      volunteering and participating in religious activities and events. I believe that by serving others and spreading the message of Islam, I can make a positive 
      impact on the lives of those around me.
